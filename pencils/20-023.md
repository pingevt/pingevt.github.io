## Brotherhood | 20-023

![Your Pencil](/pencils/imgs/20023/header-023.png)

| **Name:**     | Brotherhood |
| **Date:**     | 11-23-2020  |
| **Edition:**  | 1 of 8      |
| **Material:** | Hokie Heart |

### Details:

As legend has it, in the early years of Blacksburg and Virginia Tech, the miners were under extreme pressure to mine and produce Hokie Stone for the vast building projects and expansion of Virginia Tech. So they dug deep and quick, never considering the consequences. They dug too deep, disturbing the very foundations of Blacksburg and were forced to stop in fear of destroying the very thing they toiled for. However, at these depths, the tremendous heat and pressure transformed some of these stones into brilliant gems and what we call today __Hokie Heart__. Rare and unable to mine any more, __Hokie Heart__ is of considerable value to all Hokies. I was able to obtain just a small amount of the remaining gems and from those, crafted a set of pencils with great power.
